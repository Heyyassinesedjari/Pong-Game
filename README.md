# Pong Game
Just like The Snake game java project. <br/>
It's a simple pong game using Abstract Window Toolkit (awt) and Java Swing to display it.<br/>
I did this project as mentioned in the Snake project to discover java and eclipse IDE and because I have always wanted to know how simple games were made behind the scenes.<br/>

## Requirements:
* Java runtime installed
* Windows Operating System

### How to play the game:

* Just download the PongGame.jar file
* Run it 
* Start playing with the arrows keys.
* If the snake's head collides with his own body or with one of the 4 borders you lose. 
* Then, just close the application and re-open it (I will add a restart button possibly).
